A server process that connects to a specified IRC network/server, joins a set of channels, 
and begins collecting and generating statistics about the activity in those channels.

There will be an associated EmberJS-based webapp ( eanmclaughlin/ember-irc-stats ) for displaying
the statistics using EmberJS and d3js.
